  title    = "The effects of allogrooming and social network position on
              behavioural indicators of stress in female lion-tailed macaques
              (Macaca silenus)",
  author   = "Yates, Kerrie and Stanley, Christina R and Bettridge, Caroline M",
  abstract = "Allogrooming serves an important social function in primates and
              confers short term benefits such as parasite removal and
              stress-relief. There is currently mixed evidence as to the
              immediate impact of allogrooming on an individual's stress
              levels, which may be influenced by their role in the grooming
              dyad, position in their social network, or their relationship
              with their grooming partner. In this study of seven captive adult
              female lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in a mixed sex group
              at Chester Zoo, UK, we found evidence to support a
              tension-reduction function of allogrooming. Focal animal sampling
              showed that the duration of self-directed behaviour (SDB), which
              indicates moderate to high levels of stress, was significantly
              lower in the five-minute period following allogrooming than the
              five-minute minute period preceding it for both recipients and
              groomers. However, when compared to match-control periods, both
              SDB rates and durations were significantly lower across all
              individuals in the five-minute period both before and after
              allogrooming, indicating that although allogrooming reduces
              stress, it is also more likely to occur when individuals are
              already in a relatively relaxed state. The rate and duration of
              SDB post-grooming did not correlate with the strength of a dyad's
              bond (based on proximity). This suggests that it is the act of
              allogrooming itself, rather than the identity of the partner,
              that reduces stress for both parties. Analysis of the proximity
              network highlighted a clear cost to social integration; node
              strength, a measure of the number and strength of an individual's
              direct relationships, positively correlated with the duration of
              self-directed behaviour, suggesting that more gregarious
              individuals may experience higher levels of stress. These
              findings add to the growing body of literature that examines the
              effect of the individual social environment on primate stress
              levels, and also highlight the need to further investigate the
              link between social integration and the stress experienced by
              group-living animals.",
