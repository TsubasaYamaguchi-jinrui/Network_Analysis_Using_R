               high-profile reports of intra- and interpopulation differences
               in the behavioural repertoires of primates and cetaceans,
               consistent with the existence of socially learned traditions.
               Several studies have mapped spatial differences in behaviour,
               revealing a mosaic of behavioural phenotypes within species. The
               dominant current approach attempts to determine whether this is
               cultural variation by excluding asocial learning, ecological or
               genetic factors. However, claims of animal cultures remain
               controversial because such comparisons are subject to
               weaknesses; thus, new approaches to isolating the influence of
               culture on behaviour are required. Here we suggest that, rather
               than attributing behaviour to explanatory categories,
               researchers would often be better advised to partition variance
               in behaviour to alternative sources.",

               the details of R's graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a

               works.Most of the recipes in this second edition use the updated
               version of the ggplot2 package, a powerful and flexible way to
               make graphs in R. You'll also find expanded content about the
               visual design of graphics. If you have at least a basic

@ARTICLE{Yates2022,
  title    = "The effects of allogrooming and social network position on
              behavioural indicators of stress in female lion-tailed macaques
              (Macaca silenus)",
  author   = "Yates, Kerrie and Stanley, Christina R and Bettridge, Caroline M",
  abstract = "Allogrooming serves an important social function in primates and
              confers short term benefits such as parasite removal and
              stress-relief. There is currently mixed evidence as to the
              immediate impact of allogrooming on an individual's stress
              levels, which may be influenced by their role in the grooming
              dyad, position in their social network, or their relationship
              with their grooming partner. In this study of seven captive adult
              female lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in a mixed sex group
              at Chester Zoo, UK, we found evidence to support a
              tension-reduction function of allogrooming. Focal animal sampling
              showed that the duration of self-directed behaviour (SDB), which
              indicates moderate to high levels of stress, was significantly
              lower in the five-minute period following allogrooming than the
              five-minute minute period preceding it for both recipients and
              groomers. However, when compared to match-control periods, both
              SDB rates and durations were significantly lower across all
              individuals in the five-minute period both before and after
              allogrooming, indicating that although allogrooming reduces
              stress, it is also more likely to occur when individuals are
              already in a relatively relaxed state. The rate and duration of
              SDB post-grooming did not correlate with the strength of a dyad's
              bond (based on proximity). This suggests that it is the act of
              allogrooming itself, rather than the identity of the partner,
              that reduces stress for both parties. Analysis of the proximity
              network highlighted a clear cost to social integration; node
              strength, a measure of the number and strength of an individual's
              direct relationships, positively correlated with the duration of
              self-directed behaviour, suggesting that more gregarious
              individuals may experience higher levels of stress. These
              findings add to the growing body of literature that examines the
              effect of the individual social environment on primate stress
              levels, and also highlight the need to further investigate the
              link between social integration and the stress experienced by
              group-living animals.",

  abstract  = "The application and interpretation of statistics are central to
               ecological study and practice. Ecologists are now asking more
               sophisticated questions than in the past. These new questions,
               together with the continued growth of computing power and the
               availability of new software, have created a new generation of
               statistical techniques. These have resulted in major recent
               developments in both our understanding and practice of
               ecological statistics. This novel book synthesizes a number of
               these changes, addressing key approaches and issues that tend to
               be overlooked in other books such as missing/censored data,
               correlation structure of data, heterogeneous data, and complex
               causal relationships. These issues characterize a large
               proportion of ecological data, but most ecologists' training in
               traditional statistics simply does not provide them with
               adequate preparation to handle the associated challenges.
               Uniquely, Ecological Statistics highlights the underlying links
               among many statistical approaches that attempt to tackle these
               issues. In particular, it gives readers an introduction to
               approaches to inference, likelihoods, generalized linear (mixed)
               models, spatially or phylogenetically-structured data, and data
               synthesis, with a strong emphasis on conceptual understanding
               and subsequent application to data analysis. Written by a team
               of practicing ecologists, mathematical explanations have been
               kept to the minimum necessary. This user-friendly textbook will
               be suitable for graduate students, researchers, and
               practitioners in the fields of ecology, evolution, environmental
               studies, and computational biology who are interested in
               updating their statistical tool kits. A companion web site
               provides example data sets and commented code in the R language.",

               techniques for analyzing social network data, including digital
               media • Explains a range of statistical models including QAP and
               ERGM, giving you the tools to approach different types of
